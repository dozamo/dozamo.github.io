## Question

{{< alert color="primary" >}}
Your team selected you for this task because of your deep filesystem and disk/devices expertise. Solve the following steps to not let your team down:

1. Format `/dev/vdb` with `ext4`, mount it to `/mnt/backup-black` and create empty file `/mnt/backup-black/completed`.
1. Find which of the two disks, `/dev/vdc` or `/dev/vdd`, has higher storage usage.
    - Then empty the `.trash` folder on it.
1. There are two processes running: `dark-matter-v1` and `dark-matter-v2`.
    - Find the one that consumes more memory or virtual memory.
    - Then `unmount` the disk where the process executable is located on.
